## Coding Style Guide


### HTML Style
The HTML for this website will follow the standards set by W3Schools. Click [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp) to view the guide in full.

This includes:

 - All element and attribute names in lowercase

 - Closing all tags, even if not required

 - Attributes in double quotes

 - Including an ‘alt’ tag for all images


### CSS/SASS Style
CSS and SASS will follow AirBnb’s CSS/SASS coding style which you can find [here.](https://github.com/airbnb/css)

This styling is also all lowercase, which complements the HTML styling. 


### JS Style
For JavaScript, a W3Schools guide will be used again. This can be found [here.](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp) and includes:

 - Using camelcase for variable names

 - Having spaces around operators and after commas

 - Using semicolons after simple statements


### Naming Conventions 
Files, folders and images will all be named in lowercase, with spaces being represented with underscores. No numbers will be used whatsoever.
