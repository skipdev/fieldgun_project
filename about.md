  <div class="col-12"><p>Running field gun is hard work; it is said to be the toughest team event in the world. It takes dedication, discipline and commitment to complete a field gun season, but the rewards as far as personal achievement is concerned are phenomenal.
                          Eastbourne Youth Field Gun’s vision is to train youngsters, (13 -18) in order to preserve and promote Command Field Gun as a competitive sport. In addition we have our own competitive ‘flat run’ which we display at shows across the UK.
                          We are always on the lookout for new recruits to train at Fisherman’s Green, BN22 7LA. where you will be introduced to your best friend – a Command, ½ Tonne Cadet field gun and limber. Contact us to get involved.</p></div>
