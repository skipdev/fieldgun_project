        Running field gun is hard work; it is said to be the
        <b>toughest team event in the world.</b> It takes dedication, discipline
        and commitment to complete a field gun season, but the rewards as far as
        personal achievement is concerned are phenomenal.

        Eastbourne Youth Field Gun’s vision is to train youngsters,
        <b>(13 - 18)</b> in order to preserve and promote Command Field Gun as a
        competitive sport. In addition we have our own competitive
        <b>‘flat run’</b> which we display at shows across the UK. We are always
        on the lookout for new recruits to train at
        <b>Fisherman’s Green, BN22 7LA.</b> Here you will be introduced to your
        best friend – a Command, ½ Tonne Cadet field gun and limber. Please
        <a class="regular-link" href="/contact">contact us</a> to get involved.
